The Big Four firm is preparing to launch an automated economist which it says can predict UK GDP trends with 92% accuracy
Referring to it as “a combination of human plus machine learning”, it said the software will first be used to predict PwC’s quarterly UK Economic Outlook in July.

PwC has been working on the software which it said can predict GDP “with incredible accuracy” for the last few months.

PwC’s director of economics Jonathan Gillham told economia, “Nowcasting’ is quite a prevalent technique used these days for short-term economic forecasting, but with this machine learning tool we’re able to more accurately predict the twists and turns in the economy.

“Forecasters have traditionally found GDP most difficult to predict when for example the first quarter shows growth, but growth contracts and changes direction in the second quarter – now we can use a big data approach to assess a wide range of economic indicators to predict the best variables to focus on in order to get a more accurate result.”

Gillham said the 92% accuracy reflects the firm’s ability to predict changes in GDP from one quarter to the next.

“We have also tested how our model performs against the Office for National Statistics’ preliminary measure of GDP,” he said.

“Testing our model historically we are also able to marginally outperform other well-recognised forecasters.”

He added that PwC is considering all the implications of such innovations, and said the firm has recently put a Responsible Technology policy in place.
